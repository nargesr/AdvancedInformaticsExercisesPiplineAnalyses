# Advanced Informatics Exercises Winter 2021

##  Week 1

i) Organize "the data"

I use pythonc and symlinks (`os.symlink()`) to link the data. you can find scripts in [`script/week1/`](https://github.com/nargesr/AdvancedInformaticsExercisesPiplineAnalyses/tree/main/script/week1).

ii)  do some qc on one raw data file using fastqc

I ran fastqc on ADL06_1_1 raw data from the DNA-seq experiment. You can find the result [`fastqc/`](https://github.com/nargesr/AdvancedInformaticsExercisesPiplineAnalyses/tree/main/fastqc).
