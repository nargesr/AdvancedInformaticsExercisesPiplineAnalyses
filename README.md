# AdvancedInformaticsExercisesPiplineAnalyses

##  Week 1

i) Organize "the data"

I use a python script and use symlinks via os.symlink(). you can find scripts in [`script/week1/`](https://github.com/nargesr/AdvancedInformaticsExercisesPiplineAnalyses/tree/main/script/week1).

ii)  do some qc on one raw data file using fastqc

I ran fastqc on ADL06_1_1 raw data from the DNA-seq experiment. You can find the result [here](https://github.com/nargesr/AdvancedInformaticsExercises_week6/tree/main/fastqc).
